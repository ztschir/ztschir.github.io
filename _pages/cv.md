### EyeLock
_Director of Research Development, September 2018 to Present_
  
System Architect and Lead R&D Engineer for Iris recognition technology. Created roadmaps and project schedules for future features and products. Led the Embedded Algorithm and R&D teams to design novel vision algorithms and verification tools that enhance the overall product stability and feature set. Mentored teams to produce consistent, updated, and reliable code that works in multiple environments. Worked with R&D Team to produce simulation software to accurately predict hardware performance, with the intention of estimating hardware yields and future designs.
  
### Advanced Micro Devices
_Scientific Applications Researcher, June 2017 to September 2018_
  
Worked with a small team to write several proposals, including the winning $600 Million DoE Frontier contract. Liaised with The Department of Energy to study exascale computing architectures and conduct research on elements critical to building the next generation supercomputer. Worked with lead scientist to port hydrodynamics, molecular dynamics, and neutron transport applications to run on AMD hardware while simultaneously consulted with low-level hardware specialist to create simulations. Interfaced between the DOE and other AMD research teams to provide consistent software solutions throughout AMD Research. Presented research to company wide meetings in order to drive the development of hardware to accommodate general HPC application trends. Identified overlap in contractual software requirements and managed the consolidation effort. Used a combination of HCC/C++AMP, C, C++ 11/17, Fortran, OpenMP 3.1/4.5, OpenACC, MPI, and OpenCL to complete this research.
  
### The University of Texas at Austin (Oden Institute)
_O'Donnell PhD Fellow, September 2016 to June 2017_
  
Full-time PhD studies and research for Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics. Received Stipend and Fellowship from the O'Donnell Foundation.

### ForeFlight
_Software Engineering Consultant, July 2014 to April 2015_
  
Created interfaces and drivers for avionic cockpit hardware used by the ForeFlight iPad application. Guided meetings between several third-party hardware and software vendors to create a single compatible API, which reduced ForeFlight labor constraints. Created a standard procedure for which new vendors could easily adapt hardware and software to work for ForeFlight framework. Identified and fixed several outstanding bugs found in previous hardware drivers. Educated software developers on data modeling and simple machine learning, and then implemented a quadratic regression algorithm which reduced overall compute costs in the application.
  
### TrackingPoint
_R&D Engineer, February 2013 to July 2014_
  
Led, Proposed, and implemented two engineering projects, one of which was a high reliability autonomous robot used to test system tracking accuracy. Debugged, developed, and tested software and hardware for the newly created precision guided system using a combination of Matlab and C/C++. Development projects included tweaking computer vision tracking algorithms, maintaining the custom embedded Linux kernel, modification of hardware drivers, and adding additional features to the iOS applications. A full time position was offered following graduation.
  
### International Business Machines
_Real-time Software Developer, May 2012 to February 2013_
  
Created a dependable Automatic Build Verification Process for the iOS Sametime software suite. Guided fellow intern to complete a compatible Android counterpart. Met project guidelines of creating a testing framework that was both expendable and had tests that were intuitive to developers and testers. IBM extended the internship after the project was complete and moved me on the development team to work on the iOS Sametime application.
  
### RW3 Technologies
_Software Developer, November 2010 to May 2012_
  
Developed software in a test driven, agile environment using C#, ASP .NET and MSSQL in a MVC framework to deliver custom solutions to clients.
