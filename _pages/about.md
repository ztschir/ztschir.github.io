As someone with a wide breadth of technical experience and knowledge, my strongest strength is bringing together and organizing interdisciplinary pieces of a complex project. It is essential to understand the different layers between hardware and software to efficiently plan and communicate with key stakeholders. My experience with low-level hardware interaction ranges from GPU/CPU/ASIC pathway optimization to embedded RTOS ARM firmware development; while software design ranges from High Performance Cluster Compute to Celestial Orbital Trajectory estimation. My background in Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics allows for a fluid transition in communication techniques and deriving several perspectives.
