As someone with a wide breadth of technical knowledge and experience, my strength lies in bringing together and organizing people and departments of different technical disciplines within a complex project. In my experience, it is essential to understand the different layers between hardware and software to efficiently plan and communicate with key stakeholders. 
  
My expertise with low-level hardware interaction ranges from GPU/CPU/ASIC pathway optimization to embedded RTOS ARM firmware development; while software design ranges from High Performance Cluster Compute to Celestial Orbital Trajectory estimation. My background in (Aerospace) Engineering, Computational Science, and Mathematics allows for a fluid transition in communication techniques and deriving several perspectives to a single problem.
