excerpt: 'This project was designed to solve the issue of implementing an iterative optimization algorithm in Trick. The goal was to first define a concrete, achievable objective around which a plan of action could be developed, and then implement an optimization method in Trick. Once an optimization method had been determined, the next step was to implement it in a simple proof- of-concept Trick simulation so that eventually we have the necessary tools to eventually integrate the targeting algorithm in a Trick simulation using JEOD.
