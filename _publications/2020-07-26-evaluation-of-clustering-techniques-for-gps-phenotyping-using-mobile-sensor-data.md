excerpt: 'With the ubiquitousness of mobile smart phones, health researchers are increasingly interested in leveraging these commonplace devices as data collection instruments for near real-time data to aid in remote monitoring, and to support analysis and detection of patterns associated with a variety of health-related outcomes. As such, this work focuses on the analysis of GPS data collected through an open-source mobile platform over two months in support of a larger study being undertaken to develop a digital phenotype for pregnancy using smart phone data. 

An exploration of a variety of off-the-shelf clustering methods was completed to assess accuracy and runtime performance for a modest time-series of 292K non-uniform samples on the Stampede2 system at TACC. Motivated by phenotyping needs to not-only assess the physical coordinates of GPS clusters, but also the accumulated time spent at high-interest locations, two additional approaches were implemented to facilitate cluster time accumulation using a pre-processing step that was also crucial in improving clustering accuracy and scalability.'
